ExPASy.py is a local version of the ExPASy bioinformatics tool which can be found here https://web.expasy.org/translate/
It is used to convert DNA sequences to Amino Acid sequences. This tool can also be used to predict the three different Amino Acid sequences possible given a DNA sequence. I built a modified and more advanced version of this for research which was used to predict the most likely DNA sequences given short Amino Acid sequences.

geneTrack.py is a functional model of a mendelian gene. By passing in two alleles for the gene, the program can generate iterations of offspring with predicted combination frequencies (phenotypes and genotypes), and offspring can be selected to create successive crosses. I started making this tool to do my bio homework faster but it turned out to be an interesting programming exercise that got me interested in computational bio.
